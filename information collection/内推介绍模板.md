我写的200词的第三人称介绍自我感觉算符合要求，地里5家公司的好心人已经帮忙内推，还找过美国人内推，对方看到介绍后二话不说就推了。简单概括下我写的内容：姓名年级专业，寻找的职位和时间，成绩，CS方面兴趣（这几个点一共4-5句话就好），过去的经验（2-3个，每个一句话，每句就是一个主句一个从句这么长）。然后写自己的1-2个优点，每个优点用证据支撑，证据就是自己过去某个项目里干过的具体某件事，一句话就行，突出重点。比如写一个debug的经历，就写bug是哪个方面的，都做了哪些事去debug就行，bug的具体内容肯定是写不下的。
这样差不多就有200词啦。
可以分段写。全部塞一个段落里感觉不太好。
我在介绍里有放公司的具体名字，所以每换一个公司内推就一定要把公司名字换掉。
