## Question

875. Koko Eating Bananas
Medium

Koko loves to eat bananas.  There are N piles of bananas, the i-th pile has piles[i] bananas.  The guards have gone and will come back in H hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of K.  Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile.  If the pile has less than K bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.

Return the minimum integer K such that she can eat all the bananas within H hours.

 

Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], H = 8
Output: 4


## Solution

二分法
题目主要是不易想到使用二分法。但是因为可选项是有序并且连续的，所以在暴力解构思过程中应该能想到使用二分法
本题要注意很多细节：

- 左闭右开区间
- `mid = left+((right-left)>>1);`

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int H) {
        int left = 1;
        int right=0;
        for(auto p:piles){
            if(right<p)
                right = p;
        }
        right++;
        int mid;
        while(left < right){
            mid = left+((right-left)>>1);
            if(canfinish(piles,H,mid))
                right = mid;
            else
                left = mid+1;
        }
        return left;
    }
    
    bool canfinish(vector<int>& piles, int H, int speed){
        int time=0;
        for(auto p:piles){
            time += p/speed + (p%speed>0?1:0);
        }
        return time<=H;
    }
};
```
