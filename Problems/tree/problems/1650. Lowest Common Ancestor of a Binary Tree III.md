## Question

1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III

Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:

class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."


## Solution

有了parent指针，可以通过p,q节点向上查找。对于一棵树，向下查找是tree，向上查找是list。所以问题变成两个list的交点。

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    Node* lowestCommonAncestor(Node* p, Node * q) {
        if(!p || !q) return nullptr;
        Node* orip = p;
        Node* oriq = q;
        while(p!=q){
            if(p->parent)
                p = p->parent;
            else
                p = oriq;
            if(q->parent)
                q = q->parent;
            else
                q = orip;
            
        }
        return p;
    }
};
```
