## Question

117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
Medium

Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

 

Follow up:

    You may only use constant extra space.
    Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.


## Solution

```C++

class Solution {
public:
//level order traversal
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        if(!root) return nullptr;
        queue<Node*> q;
        Node *inter;
        Node* pre;
        q.push(root);
        while(!q.empty()){
            int size = q.size();
            pre = nullptr;
            for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
                inter = q.front();
                q.pop();
                inter->next = pre;
                pre = inter;
                
                if(inter->right) q.push(inter->right);
                if(inter->left) q.push(inter->left);
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
    
    //Linked List traversal
    Node* connect(Node* root){
        if(!root) return nullptr;
        Node* curr = root;
        while(curr){
            Node* dummy = new Node(-1);
            Node* pre = dummy;
            while(curr){
                if(curr->left){
                    pre->next = curr->left;
                    pre = pre->next;
                }
                if(curr->right){
                    pre->next = curr->right;
                    pre = pre->next;
                }
                curr = curr->next;
            }
            curr = dummy->next;
            delete dummy;
        }
        return root;
    }
};
