1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
Medium

There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points The points are given in the integer array cardPoints.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly k cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score you can obtain.

## Solution

本题的关键在于想清楚一共n张卡，抽走k张，还剩（n-k）张，从整体角度看问题。讨论整体情况的窗口位置

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int res=0;
        int currsum=0;
        int totalsum=0;
        int n=cardPoints.size();
        int length = n-k;
        for(int i=0;i<cardPoints.size();i++){
            if(i<length)
                currsum += cardPoints[i];
            totalsum += cardPoints[i];
        }
        res = currsum;
        for(int j=length;j<cardPoints.size();j++){
            currsum = currsum+cardPoints[j]-cardPoints[j-(n-k)];
            res = min(currsum,res);
        }
        return totalsum-res;
    }
};
```
